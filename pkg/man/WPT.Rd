\title{Weather Prediction Task data}

\description{
	This data set contains responses of 25 participants (9 amnesic and 16
	matched control) in the Weather Prediction Task (WPT). Control participants are labelled
  as \code{id} = C1 to C16 and amnesic participants as \code{id} = A1 to A9.
  In the WPT, participants make
	predictions (\code{r}) of the state of the weather (\code{y}, 0 = sunny, 1 = rainy), on the
	basis of four ``tarot cards'' (x1-x4, 0 = absent, 1 = present). The WPT
  consists of 200 trials.
