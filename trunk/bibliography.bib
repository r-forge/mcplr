  abstract = {A unified quantitative approach to modeling subjects' identification
	and categorization of multidimensional perceptual stimuli is proposed
	and tested. Two subjects identified and categorized the same set
	of perceptually confusable stimuli varying on separable dimensions.
	The identification data were modeled using Shepard's (1957) multidimensional
	scaling-choice framework. This framework was then extended to model
	the subjects' categorization performance. The categorization model,
	which generalizes the context theory of classification developed
	by Medin and Schaffer (1978), assumes that subjects store category
	exemplars in memory. Classification decisions are based on the similarity
	of stimuli to the stored exemplars. It is assumed that the same multidimensional
	perceptual representation underlies performance in both the identification
	and categorization paradigms. However, because of the influence of
	selective attention, similarity relationships change systematically
	across the two paradigms. Some support was gained for the hypothesis
	that subjects distribute attention among component dimensions so
	as to optimize categorization performance. Evidence was also obtained
	that subjects may have augmented their category representations with
	inferred exemplars. Implications of the results for theories of multidimensional
	scaling and categorization are discussed.},
